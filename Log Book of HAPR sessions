LOG #2 - 14/1/2014: 2:30 - 5:30

	- Jay finished sound effect document and started work on how we would
	  implement the all the effects

	  the DC bias on the signal

LOG #2 - 15/1/2014:
	- Oli added looping buffer and averaging to analgoue signal
	- Oli researched adding a DC bias to the input of the board in
	  order to prevent loss of signal upon input to the board.
		- Found circuit to increase bias:
		http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/14404/dc-biasing-audio-signal
			- Second diagram of answer explains how to add the bias
			- Use the values given in the diagram
