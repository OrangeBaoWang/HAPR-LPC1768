LOG OF HAPR PRACTICAL SESSIONS

LOG #1 - 14/1/2014: 9:30 - 12:30

	- Oli taught Daz and Jay how to use GIT
	- Everybody now proffecient in GIT
	- Jay started document describing all the sound effects we will implement 
	- Oli set up GIT repository
	- Oli and Daz worked on the ADC, so far not working

LOG #2 - 14/1/2014: 2:30 - 5:30

	- Jay finished sound effect document and started work on how we would
	  implement the all the effects
	- Got the ADC and the DAC working
	- Oli and Daz working on a low pass filter and op-amp to remove
	  the DC bias on the signal

LOG #2 - 15/1/2014:
	- Oli added looping buffer and averaging to analgoue signal
	- Oli researched adding a DC bias to the input of the board in
	  order to prevent loss of signal upon input to the board.
		- Found circuit to increase bias:
		http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/14404/dc-biasing-audio-signal
			- Second diagram of answer explains how to add the bias
			- Use the values given in the diagram


LOG #3 - 16/1/2014
	- Oli and Daz worked on new op-amp and correcting D.C bias by doing this at input instead of outut
	- Jay found circuits to apply Compression to signal
		- Difficult to implement however

LOG #4 - 20/1/2014
	- Weekend work done by Oli
		- Fixed bugs and added a filter chain of linked lists with pointers
		- Added testings and made code neater
		- Added filter chain full supports and usuage
		- Updated testings
	- Oli "We need 64 bits precision"
		- Daz "Sometimes you just have to put your balls to the wall"
	- Oli "Bitches love a good filter chain"

LOG #5 - 20/1/2014
	- Linear gain, reverb, delay and echo filters now all work
	- Changed opamp resistors to a 100K and a 3.3K

LOG #6 - From Last time to 10/2/2014

	- Project has reached V1.0!! Horray brahs
	- All features have been implemented apart from a few individual filters
	- Oli changed interrupts so program got to while loop
	- 4 weeks early, great success.
	- Now comments need to be added to confusing parts, and we could do with more information on exactly what the presentation involves
	- Final individual filters to be added by Jay and Daz, Oli has done lots already
	- 
	
LOG #7 - 18/2/2014
  - Jay finished his filter. Has teething issues but will be fixed.
  - Oli finished pass through filter.
  - Daz finished low, high and band pass filters, but those were easier than Jays mum
  - Envelope filter is proving hard. May try a different filter.
