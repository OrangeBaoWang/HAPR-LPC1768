Compressor
	- Reduces volume of loud sound or amplifies quite sounds
		- Does this by compressing an audio signals dynamic range
	
		- Downward Compression, reduces loud sounds, quiet sounds remain 			  unaffected
			- Apply gain reduction to the loud section of signal
			- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Audio-level-compresion-    				  diagram-01.svg

		- Upward Compression, increases sound of quiet sounds, loud sounds 			  unaffected
			- Apply gain increase to quiet section of signal

	- HWWDT
		- Clipping
		- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_%28signal_processing%	29#Analog_circuitry
		-We can do it digitally, by using 16-bit signed integers, doubling the sample values

		- UPDATED
			- We need to clip it by using low and high pass filters
				- Store signal
					- Run it through low pass filter
					- Run original through high pass filter
					- Combine the 2 new signals
			- Attack time is the time it takes for signal to become compressed
			- Release time is the time it takes for signal to revert from compressed to normal
			
			- We can also use a FET to apply compression

			- If we could build that circuit http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/87989/how-do-i-implement-soft-clipping-in-an-audio-circuit-or-should-i-just-attenuate


Envolope Follower
	- Responds to the incoming signal in different ways depending on the signal
		- It could be set up so the filter is more closed on soft guitar strums
		- Or it could be set up to be more open on loud guitar strums

	- Can use the Envolope follower to vary the "attack" (fast/slow) based on the
	  input signal for effects.
		- Useful = http://www.abletonop.com/2011/07/auto-filter-        		  modulation-part-ii-envelope-follower/

	- Used to curve parts of the signal to make it sound different
	

	- HWWDT
		- Monitor incoming signal
		- When it reaches part that we want it to have
		- Apply filter to it
			- Low Pass/High Pass perhaps to vary sound

Phaser
	- Creates a "sweeping" effect by making a series of peaks and troughs in the 		  signal
		- Does this by using a low-frequency oscillator and below
		- Split audio signal into 2 paths
			- 1 Path uses an all-pass filter to preserve amplitude and 				  alter phase
			- The other path can be anything, change the pitch, delay, etc
		- These 2 paths are then joined together to create the overall effect

	- Notch Filter frequently mentioned
	
	- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaser_%28effect%29

Chorus
	- When individual sounds with similar tone and pitch, all come together and are
	  perceived as one sound

	- To create this
		- Take input signal
		- Mix it with one or more delayed, pitch modulated copies of itself
			- To modulate pitch use a Low-frequency oscillator 
	
	- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_effect

Vibrato
	- The effect of regular, pulsating change of pitch, the vibrating effect
		- Can vary amount of pitch and speed of pitch is varied at
	
	- Useful http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrato_unit

	- To create this
		- Use a combination of delays and filters
		- NOT MUCH INFO AVAILABLE, COULD BE HARD

Tremelo
	- Very similar to Vibrato, the trembling effect
	- Two types
		- First type
			- rapid reiteration, playing the same note again and again
		- Second type
			- variation in amplitude
			- rapidly turning volume up or down
	- "Whammy Bar"
	
	- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo

Reverb
	- A reverb is when a sound is produced in an enclosed space, lots of echoes 		  build up then die down as the sound is absorbed
	
	- To create
		- Use multiple feedback, delay circuits to create a large, decaying 			  series of echoes
	
	- Advanced
		- Simulate the time and the frequency responses of the CS Lab


Distortion
	- Creates "warm", "dirty" and "fuzzy" sounds by compressing the peaks of the 		  audio signal

	- For Fuzzy distortion 
		-  Alter signal until it is nearly a square wave and add overtones by 			   way of a frequency multiplier
			- Frequency multiplier use a bandpass filter to choose desired 				  frequency

	- OverDrive
		- Amplifies signal so it distorts massively
			- Very easy

Pitch Shift(Notes say Difficult)
	- The pitch of the audio signal is raised or lowered
	
	- To create replaying the audio signal at a different speed than it was 	  recorded

	- Note, not much information available

Noise Filter
	- Nothing comes up, closest is Noise Reduction
