Compressor
	- Reduces volume of loud sound or amplifies quite sounds
		- Does this by compressing an audio signals dynamic range
	
	- Downward Compression, reduces loud sounds, quiet sounds remain unaffected
		- Apply gain reduction to the loud section of signal
		- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Audio-level-compresion-diagram-01.svg

	- Upward Compression, increases sound of quiet sounds, loud sounds unaffected
		- Apply gain increase to quiet section of signal

Envolope Follower
	- Responds to the incoming signal in different ways depending on the signal
		- It could be set up so the filter is more closed on soft guitar strums
		- Or it could be set up to be more open on loud guitar strums

	- Can use the Envolope follower to vary the "attack" (fast/slow) based on the
	  input signal for effects.

Phaser
	- Creates a "sweeping" effect by making a series of peaks and troughs in the 		  signal
		- Does this by using a low-frequency oscillator and below
		- Split audio signal into 2 paths
			- 1 Path uses an all-pass filter to preserve amplitude and alter
			  phase
			- The other path can be anything, change the pitch, delay, etc
		- These 2 paths are then joined together to create the overall effect

	- Notch Filter frequently mentioned

Chorus
	- When individual sounds with similar tone and pitch, all come together and are
	  perceived as one sound

	- To create this
		- Take input signal
		- Mix it with one or more delayed, pitch modulated copies of itself
			- To modulate pitch use a Low-frequency oscillator

Vibrato
	- The effect of regular, pulsating change of pitch, the vibrating effect
		- Can vary amount of pitch and speed of pitch is varied at
	
	- Useful http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrato_unit

	- To create this
		- Use a combination of delays and filters
		- NOT MUCH INFO AVAILABLE, COULD BE HARD

Tremelo
	- Very similar to Vibrato, the trembling effect
	- Two types
		- First type
			- rapid reiteration, playing the same note again and again
		- Second type
			- variation in amplitude
			- rapidly turning volume up or down
	- "Whammy Bar"
